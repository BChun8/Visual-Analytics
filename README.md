# Visual-Analytics
This is just to show that I have some basic and adequate knowledge of how to build simple but effective visualizations.

DATA GATHERING:
The dataset that I used was from a Global Superstore. Essentially, sales data from a retail store that would sell furniture, office supplies and electronics/technology equipment.

DATA VISUALIZATION: 
A lot of the processes, as mentioned earlier were about creating simple but effective visualizations. The scope of this visualization has been to create sets, clustering, trend lines, heat plots, parameters, filters and color-time data that can distinguish metrics for sales revenues.

Many of these visualizations/dashboards are the foundations for more advanced forms of analytics that can be done.
